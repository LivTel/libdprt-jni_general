# libdprt-jni_general

This is part of the libdprt package, which provides (real-time) data pipelines for Liverpool Telescope instruments.
This particular sub-module provides generic JNI 'glue' routines that other instrument-specific modules use to call C libdprt data-pipelines from the DpRt Java layer.

# Installation

The repository should be installed inside the libdprt directory in an LT development environment. The directory name should be renamed to 'jni_general' or soft-linked.

# Prerequisites

- LT Development environment
